# DBTC-Analysis
These are the 4 scripts I used to create the charts here:

## RPC Endpoint
In order to run most of the scripts you need to run a Defichain full node because they are using RPC calls to the full node.
You need to create a file called rpcEndpoint in the folder src which contains the RPC endpoint to connect to.
This might look like this: http://user:password@127.0.0.1:8555
